# Password-Generator

## General info
When the user clicks the 'generate password' button, the user is asked a series of questions to select their password length and the type of characters they'd like to include. The password generator creates a random password based on the user-selected criteria. The app is powered by javaScript, and features a responsive design updated with HTML and CSS.
